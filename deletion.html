  <h1>User Data Deletion Policy - Sheristan</h1>

  <h2>1. User Right to Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Users of Sheristan have the right to delete their account and associated personal
    data permanently at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Retention and Deletion Timing</h2>
  <p>
    Sheristan stores personal data only for as long as the user maintains an active
    account. Once the user deletes their account, all associated personal data is
    permanently removed from our systems.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Scope of Data Deleted</h2>
  <p>
    Upon successful account deletion, the following data associated with the user
    account is permanently removed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, email address, phone number (if applicable), username, and profile picture</li>
    <li>User-generated content, including shers/quotes, likes, and comments</li>
    <li>Device token</li>
    <li>Any other personal data stored within our systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How to Request Deletion (Procedure)</h2>
  <p>
    Users must initiate the deletion request through the Sheristan mobile application.
    Since Sheristan uses Google and Facebook authentication, deletion requests must be
    submitted via the same app interface through which the account was created.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>In-App Deletion:</strong> Navigate to the <strong>Account Settings</strong>
      section in the Sheristan app and select the option to
      <strong>“Delete your account and data permanently.”</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Sheristan integrates with Google and Facebook strictly for authentication purposes.
    Data collected by these third-party services is governed by their own privacy
    policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to delete data held by Google or Facebook, you must initiate deletion
    requests directly with those service providers through their respective platforms.
  </p>
